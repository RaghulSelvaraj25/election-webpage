        <p>DMK is part of Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance, which was formed on 18 July 2023. On 25
            September 2023, AIADMK withdrew from the Bharatiya Janata Party-led National Democratic Alliance to form and
            lead the new alliance, AIADMK+.

            On 19 January 2024, DMK constituted a seven-member committee to hold consultations with alliance partners
            for seat sharing. On 22 January, AIADMK set up a 5-member committee to hold seat sharing talks with alliance
            partners. On 26 January, CPI(M) formed a four membered panel for seat sharing with DMK. Central committee
            members P. Sampath, P. Shanmugam and state committee members N. Gunasekaran and K. Kanagaraj were included
            in the panel. On February 5, Bharatiya Janata Party-led National Democratic Alliance held seat sharing talks
            with Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam.

            0n 19 March 2024 the Bharatiya Janata Party finalised seat sharing a with the Pattali Makkal Katchi as part
            of the National Democratic Alliance, were the party will contest 10 seats in Tamil Nadu.

            0n 20 March 2024, AIADMK General Secretary Edappadi K. Palaniswami released the first list, comprising 16
            candidates contesting the election. The Party finalised seat sharing and allotted one seat each to its
            allies SDPI, PT and five Seats to DMDK. 0n March 21, Palaniswami released the second and final list,
            comprising 16 AIADMK candidates contesting the election.</p>

        <p>Mr. Palaniswami said the decade long AIADMK rule was not dark as claimed by the Chief Minister but it was a
            people’s government. He said the Chief Minister during his election campaigns had been dubbing the period
            when the AIADMK was in power, as a ‘dark rule’.

            This is contrary to truth. Instead, it was only when AlADMK was in power, many welfare schemes centred on
            people’s interest were implemented, he contended.

            Mr. Palaniswami also accused the ruling DMK of indulging in political vendetta by keeping theAdvanced
            Institute of Integrated Research in Livestock and Animal Science (AIIRLAS), the largest in Asia, near
            Thalaivasal locked for the last three years since it was brought by the AIADMK regime. The Government has
            been adopting a short-sighted approach by keeping the facility unutilised, he said.

            He called upon the people to use their vote to defeat the DMK responsible for the prevailing “law and order
            situation and administrative misdeeds, losing State’ rights and circulation of banned drugs.”</p>
